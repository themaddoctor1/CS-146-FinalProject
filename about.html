        <p>What did you just say about me? I’ll have you know I graduated in Woodbridge High School, and I’ve been involved in numerous projects in programming, and I have over 300 confirmed Git commits. I am trained in Web Development and I’m the top software developer in my dorm. You are nothing to me but just another intern. I will pass this class with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with doubting me? Think again. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of hackers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm. The storm that wipes out the thing you call a website. You’re finished, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can write this website in over seven ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in programming, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the shelf in my room and I will use it to its full extent to pass this project with full marks. If only you could have known what epic code your little “clever” assignment was about to bring down upon this class. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price. I will radiate glory all over you and you will drown in it.</p>
