      <p>What did you just say about me? I’ll have you know I graduated from Woodbridge High School, and I’ve been involved in numerous projects in programming, and I have over 300 confirmed Git commits. I am trained in Web Development and I’m the top software developer in my dorm. You are nothing to me but just another intern. I will pass this class with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my words. You think you can get away with doubting me? Think again. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of hackers across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm. The storm that wipes out the thing you call a website. You’re finished, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can write this website in over seven ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in programming, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the shelf in my room and I will use it to its full extent to pass this project with full marks. If only you could have known what epic code your little “clever” assignment was about to bring down upon this class. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price. I will radiate glory all over you and you will drown in it.</p>

      <h4>David "LadyKillah" Ovsiew</h4>
      <p>Why hello there! My name is David Ovsiew, your friendly neighborhood computer science major! I graduated from Piscataway High School in central New Jersey. I was on the high school's FRC Robotics team, team 224, for all four years and was appointed captain for my senior year. Though my school didn't publish rankings I was in the top 10% of my class. I'm passionate about coding and helped to make this lovely website you're now on. Please don't let Chris scare you; he's really quite nice if you get to know him (and don't call him names).</p>

      <p>Hello everyone, my name is Qiuan Wu. I am a computer science student studying at Stevens Institute of technology.  I loving  playing billiards, basketball and guitar in my free time. I am now making a lot of effort on programming learning because I find it to be interesting. I hope this code will be the best in our class because all my teammates are very excellent coders!</p>

      <h4>"JUST" Do "IT" Park</h4>
      <p>Be 19. Doing group assignment for Borowski's class. Asked to come up with idea for the website. Suggests plumbing. itsjustaprank.jpg. Voting goes down for final decision. "You can vote for your own". Palms are sweaty. Knees weak, arms are heavy. My pick is selected already. Mom's spaghetti.</p>

      <p>Greetings, inferiors. I am no mere pleb, unlike my compatriots mentioned above. I graduated in the top 1% of my class and enter Stevens a full year of credits ahead of you rookies. I once killed a hydra with a sword of Imperial Gold while robbing the second-largest bank in Paris using nothing but a ball-point... I'm kidding. I just had to say some self-abosrbed stuff to follow in he footsteps of David and Chris. Anyway, my accomplishments *may* include many of the above, as well as a competitive bronze league career in League of Draven, a platinum account in an outdated version of StarCraft II, several weeks worth of anime binge-watching, and a grade of "A-" in 8th grade pre-algebra. My real claim to fame over the other kooks in this group is that I did "excercise" once and they say I may have even spoken with a girl. Savage, amiright? Mudslinging aside, here at Stevens I compete on the Cross Country and Track and Field teams and chill in Pierce at least 3 hours a day. Props to Qiuan for his kind words, and enjoy the site &lt;3 :*</p>
