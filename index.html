      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>Hands for Hire is a start-up based on the idea that people should be able to find the right plumber for their job as easily as possible. No matter where you are, when you need it done by, or how much you're willing to pay, we know just the plumber for you. In the spirit of helping other start-ups grow, all of our plumbers are new to the field and are held to the highest standards.</p>
      <p>The process is simple. Just go to our Search page and fill out your information. Our state-of-the-art matching algorithm will then determine the best plumber for your project and provide you with their name, contact information, the project's total cost, and start and end dates. You can then use the information to communicate with the plumber and start the project. It's that easy!</p>
      <p>Also, feel free to visit our Reviews page. There, you can find reviews for all of our plumbers. When your job is finished, please write a review of your own and let us know how we and our plumbers can improve.</p>
